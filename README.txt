All code was written and is owned by John Romo. Even if you wanted
to sell it (which you don't) you can't.

This is my first attempt at a real project  using a micro-controller  
(I did a few learning projects first, like making an LED blink). This
is a simulation of a car's multi switch (windshiled wipers and
whatnot) run on an ATmega328P.  It is written in C with Vim. I had
a DC motor hooked up originally, but that broke, so I had to replace
it with LEDs.  Really, everything here is just switches to turn on
and off LEDs and to make sure the right stuff is on at the right time.
I will be uploading a video onto youtube soon to explain in more 
detail how everything works. 

While youtube tutorials were nice with making an LED blink, there 
wasn't much there for the more complicated stuff.  I just went
right to the source and read the data sheet.  Very little in this
code will be anything similar to anyone else's, unless the way
I did it is pretty standard. I kind of doubt that since it's my
first time writing this kind of code, meaning it's probably
pretty rough.
